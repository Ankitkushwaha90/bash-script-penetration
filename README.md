Bash scripting can be used for penetration testing and vulnerability assessment in various ways. Here are some common types of Bash scripts related to security and ethical hacking:

## 1️⃣ Reconnaissance & Information Gathering
Automating nmap scans for network enumeration.
Extracting subdomains using dig, nslookup, or host.
Checking open ports with netcat (nc).
## 2️⃣ Exploitation Scripts
Automating payload generation (msfvenom, payloads.sh).
Exploiting misconfigurations (e.g., misconfigured SUID binaries).
Automating privilege escalation checks.
## 3️⃣ Post-Exploitation
Automating reverse shell connections (nc -e /bin/bash).
Extracting sensitive files (e.g., /etc/passwd, SSH keys).
Establishing persistence mechanisms.
## 4️⃣ Brute Force Attacks (Ethical Use Only)
Dictionary-based password guessing (hydra, medusa, john).
SSH brute-forcing with hydra or custom scripts.
## 5️⃣ Web Application Security
Automating directory enumeration (dirb, gobuster).
SQL injection detection (sqlmap wrapper).
Finding vulnerabilities in CMS (wpscan, joomscan).
Example: Basic Network Scan Script
```bash
Edit
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter target IP or domain:"
read TARGET
echo "Scanning $TARGET..."
nmap -A -T4 $TARGET > scan_results.txt
echo "Scan complete! Results saved in scan_results.txt"
```
